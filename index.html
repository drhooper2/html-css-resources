                    <h3>In Our Own Words</h3>
                    <p>This teacher resource guide document has been developed by the First Nations Education
                        Steering Committee (FNESC) with assistance from the British Columbia Ministry of
                        Education and support from the Education Partnerships Program of Indigenous Services
                        Canada. FNESC appreciates the support of both the Province and the Government of
                        Canada for this very important undertaking and would like to thank all who participated
                        in the process of developing this resource. In particular, FNESC acknowledges and thanks
                        all the individuals, communities, and organizations who provided the authentic content
                        that enriches the material included in this resource guide.</p>
                    <p>Many of the strategies and unit plans in this guide incorporate the use
                        of grade-appropriate story books and other learning resources
                        identified in Authentic First Peoples Resources K-9. This
                        guide is available online at fnesc.ca/authenticresources, or by clicking on the image to the left.

                    <h3>Aboriginal World View and Perspectives In The Classroom</h3>
                    <p>The inspiration for this project was to support and build upon a regional dialogue that would lead
                        to further strategies and clear commitments from all educators as we work to serve each learner,
                        families, and communities. With a spirit of collaboration, a commitment to transformation, and an
                        “If not here, where?” mindset, we approached Director Ted Cadwallader of the British Columbia Ministry of
                        Education to share our School District 85 (Vancouver Island North) aspirations. Shortly thereafter, the vision
                        and partnership was expanded to include four other school districts to host focus sessions on Aboriginal
                        Worldviews and Perspectives in the Classroom.
